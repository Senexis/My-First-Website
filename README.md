# My First Website
This is my very first website. Don't judge it too harshly. I've improved. Only recent edits I made were to remove copyrighted material. Because of course I used that in my first site. Some stuff, as a result, might not work. This website is completely Dutch, as I do not feel like going back and translating every single page. Use [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) if you must. ðŸ˜€

Honestly, this is the first website I made in full. Before this, I did some minor work on some _really_ terrible website designs, pre-dating any sort of modern standards and looks. This is the first website that comes closer to modern standards and is actually not super bad, except for being embarrasing for me.
